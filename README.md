## A Bit About `htpeter`

Hello, my name is Peter and I am a Data Scientist who currently lives and works in New York City. For money, I build adtech models and natural language models for some technology companies. 

### Curated List of Readable Things

I've decided to use this space to show off other people's proejcts that have inspired the way I explore the world.

1. FastAI's `nbdev` is a wonderful take on literate programming and has inspired my own personal use of Jupyter Notebooks to produce real and usable software! https://github.com/fastai/nbdev
2. GitHub user @karlicoss' Human Programming Interface inspires how I develop software for my own life. https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI
3. The Explosion AI team has made it possible for me to actually use NLP. I'm not sure I'd ever have gotten an NLP project up and running without them. https://spacy.io/
