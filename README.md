### Hi there, I am Peter aka @htpeter ðŸ‘‹

Earth in 2020 is so complex. If you want to understand things, you've got to pay attention to societies, economies, taxonomies, the macro, the micro, the psycho. Is Facebook taking over our brains?! Does Google know what I'm thinking right now? Will Tencent take over the world? Measuring where truths lay on spectrums of grey is complicated. Code is a very nice way to explore these spectrums.
