## A Bit About `htpeter`

Hello, my name is Peter and I am a Data Scientist who currently lives and works in New York City. I enjoy working with teams and trying to implement USEFUL machine learning products. Nowadays we want to infuse ML into many things, however its not always the best idea. I like to start by asking "What economic benefit do we get by improving our ability to predict here?". From this question, we can decide what type of methods will even be useful for a given business. 

I've recently been working on using NLP to solve business problems (thanks to `explosionai.spacy` and `huggingface.transformers`). I also have become interested in how less popular methods like Multi-Armed bandits can be used to build self-improving systems and how Monte Carlo simulation can be used to breakdown and analyze complex systems.
