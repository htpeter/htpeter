Data Scientist/Engineer building systems that learn from data. Specializing in Applied NLP, Advertising Optimization and Advanced Analytics (everything is a graph). In my free time, I am an amateur quant trading a hodgepodge of assets with silicon and maths.

### Curated List of Readable Things

I've decided to use this space to show off other people's proejcts that have inspired the way I explore the world.

1. FastAI's `nbdev` is a wonderful take on literate programming and has inspired my own personal use of Jupyter Notebooks to produce real and usable software! https://github.com/fastai/nbdev
2. GitHub user @karlicoss' Human Programming Interface inspires how I develop software for my own life. https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI
3. The Explosion AI team has made it possible for me to actually use NLP. I'm not sure I'd ever have gotten an NLP project up and running without them. https://spacy.io/
